</head>
<body>
    <h1>HTML5 is the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language
         used to create web pages. It comes with a range of new features
          and improvements over its predecessor, HTML4. Some of the notable 
          features of HTML5 are:</h1>

          <h1>1.Improved semantics: HTML5 introduces new 
            semantic elements, such as <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, 
            and <article>, which make it easier 
            to structure web content and improve accessibility for users.</h1>

            <h1>2.Audio and video support: HTML5 introduces built-in support for
                 audio and video playback, without the need for plugins like Flash.
                  It supports different audio and video codecs, making it easier to 
                  deliver multimedia content on the web.</h1>

              <h1>3.Canvas and SVG: HTML5 introduces the <canvas> element, which allows 
                developers to create graphics, animations, and other visual effects using
                 JavaScript. It also supports Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), which provides 
                 an alternative way to create vector graphics on the web.</h1>    


              <h1>4.Offline support: HTML5 provides new features for offline web applications, 
                including the ability to store data locally using the localStorage API and the 
                ability to cache web resources using the Application Cache API.</h1>   

                <h1>5.Forms and input types: HTML5 introduces new input types, such as date, time, color,
                     and range, which make it easier to create forms and collect user input.</h1>


                <h1>6.Geolocation: HTML5 provides a new Geolocation API that allows web applications 
                    to access a user's location information.</h1>  
                    
                <h1>7.Mobile support: HTML5 is designed to work well on mobile devices, with features such 
                    as responsive design and support for touch events.</h1> 
                    
                <h1>8.Overall, HTML5 provides a more powerful and flexible foundation 
                    for web development, making it easier to create rich, interactive web 
                    applications that work well across different devices and platforms.</h1>
