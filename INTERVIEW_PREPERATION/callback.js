// Q14. What is Callback?
// A callback is a plain JavaScript function passed to some method 
// as an argument or option. It is a function that is to be executed
//  after another function has finished executing, hence the name ‘call 
//  back‘. In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions 
//  can take functions as arguments, and can be returned by other functions.
