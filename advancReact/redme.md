# what is useMemo , how to use it and why to use it

useMemo is a React hook that allows you to memoize the result of a function, so that it is only recomputed when its dependencies change. It can be used to optimize the performance of your React application by avoiding unnecessary re-renders caused by expensive computations.

Here's how to use useMemo:

import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
const { a, b } = props;

const result = useMemo(() => {
// Expensive computation
return a + b;
}, [a, b]);

return <div>{result}</div>;
}

In this example, the result variable is computed using an expensive computation. However, by using useMemo, we are able to memoize the result so that it is only recomputed when the dependencies a and b change.

You might use useMemo when you have a component that renders frequently and has expensive computations, and you want to optimize the performance by reducing the number of unnecessary re-renders. However, it's important to note that premature optimization can lead to more complex and harder-to-maintain code, so use useMemo only when you notice a performance bottleneck that can be resolved with memoization.

# Q.2 Explain about type of side effects in react component

In React, side effects are operations that affect something outside the scope of a component, such as modifying the DOM, fetching data from an API, or subscribing to an event listener. When working with side effects, it's important to understand that they can be classified into two types:

1.Synchronous side effects: These are side effects that are performed synchronously and do not require any external dependencies. For example, setting the document title, updating a CSS style, or performing a simple arithmetic calculation. These effects can be executed directly in the component's render method.

2.Asynchronous side effects: These are side effects that are performed asynchronously and require external dependencies, such as data fetching or API calls. For example, making a network request, accessing browser storage, or subscribing to an event listener. These effects should be executed using React's built-in hooks, such as useEffect, useLayoutEffect, or useCallback.

useEffect is the most commonly used hook for performing asynchronous side effects in React. It allows you to perform side effects after the component has rendered and is displayed on the screen. You can specify a dependency array to tell React when the effect should be triggered. If the dependencies change, the effect will be re-triggered. If the dependencies are empty, the effect will be triggered only once, when the component mounts.

useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect, but it is executed synchronously immediately after the component has rendered. This can be useful in situations where you need to make sure that the effect is applied before the user sees the component on the screen.

In summary, understanding the different types of side effects in React can help you write more efficient and maintainable code by using the appropriate hooks and performing effects at the right time.

# Q.3 Explain Higher Order component in React

A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional functionality. It is a way to reuse component logic, and it's commonly used for cross-cutting concerns, such as authentication, logging, and error handling.

Here's an example of a Higher-Order Component that adds a "loading" state to a component:

import React, { Component } from 'react';

function withLoading(Component) {
return class WithLoading extends React.Component {
render() {
const { isLoading, ...props } = this.props;
return isLoading ? <div>Loading...</div> : <Component {...props} />;
}
};
}

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
render() {
return <div>Hello World!</div>;
}
}

export default withLoading(MyComponent);
In this example, withLoading is a Higher-Order Component that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with a loading state. The new component checks if isLoading is true, and if so, displays a "Loading..." message. Otherwise, it renders the original component with the additional props passed in.

To use the HOC, you simply need to wrap your component with the withLoading function, like this:

import React from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

function App() {
const isLoading = true;
const MyComponentWithLoading = withLoading(MyComponent);
return <MyComponentWithLoading isLoading={isLoading} />;
}

This will create a new component called MyComponentWithLoading that includes the "loading" state, and can be used in your application just like any other component.

In summary, Higher-Order Components are a powerful tool for reusing and composing component logic in React. They allow you to add functionality to existing components without modifying their source code, and can help to keep your code more modular and maintainable.

# Q.4 What is the difference between HTML and React event handling

Both HTML and React provide ways to handle events, such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or hovering over an element. However, there are some key differences between the two approaches:

1.Event Naming: HTML event names are all lowercase and follow a consistent naming pattern, such as onclick, onchange, and onsubmit. In contrast, React event names are camel-cased, and use on prefix followed by the event name, such as onClick, onChange, and onSubmit.

2.Event Handling Function: In HTML, you can handle an event by assigning a function to the corresponding event handler property of an element, such as onclick, like this:

"<button onclick="handleClick()">Click me</button>"

In React, you handle an event by passing a function to the on-prefixed event handler prop, like this:

function handleClick() {
console.log('Button clicked');
}

function MyComponent() {
return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
In React, the event handling function is passed as a reference, not a string, so you don't need to worry about scoping issues or global variables.

3.Event Propagation: In HTML, events propagate up the DOM tree from the target element to its parent and ancestor elements, unless the event is explicitly stopped using event.stopPropagation(). In React, events are handled differently - they are captured at the top level of the React tree and then propagated down to the target element. This approach is known as "synthetic events," and it allows React to handle events more efficiently and predictably.
In summary, while HTML and React event handling share some similarities, such as the types of events available, they differ in their event naming, handling function syntax, and event propagation.

# Q.5 explain difference between react.memo ,useMemo and useCallback

React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback are all React hooks that can help optimize the performance of React components. However, they have different use cases and behaviors.

## React.memo is a higher-order component that can be used to memoize a functional component, so that it only re-renders when its props change. It compares the new props to the previous props using a shallow comparison, and only re-renders the component if there are differences. This can be useful for optimizing performance in components that have expensive rendering or computation.


import React, { memo } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ prop1, prop2 }) {
// ...
}

export default memo(MyComponent);


# useMemo is a hook that can be used to memoize the result of a function, so that it only recomputes the result if its dependencies change. It takes two arguments: a function that returns the memoized value, and an array of dependencies that trigger the function to re-run when they change. This can be useful for optimizing performance in components that have expensive calculations or data processing.


import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ data }) {
const result = useMemo(() => {
// Expensive computation on data...
return someResult;
}, [data]);

return <div>{result}</div>;
}

# useCallback is a hook that can be used to memoize a function, so that it only re-creates the function if its dependencies change. It takes two arguments: a function to be memoized, and an array of dependencies that trigger the function to re-create when they change. This can be useful for optimizing performance in components that pass functions as props to child components, since it can prevent unnecessary re-renders of the child components.


import React, { useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ onClick }) {
const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
// Handle click event...
}, [onClick]);

return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}

In summary, React.memo is used to memoize a functional component, useMemo is used to memoize a value, and useCallback is used to memoize a function. They are all useful tools for optimizing the performance of React components, but have different use cases and behaviors.


# Q.6 what are the different phases of the component lifecycle


In React, the component lifecycle refers to the different stages that a component goes through from initialization to removal. The component lifecycle is divided into three main phases:

## 1 Mounting Phase: This is the first phase of the component lifecycle, where the component is created and added to the DOM. The following methods are called in order:
constructor(): This is the first method called during component creation, and is used to initialize state and bind event handlers.

static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): This method is called after constructor(), but before render(), and is used to update state based on changes in props.

render(): This method is called to generate the HTML markup for the component.

componentDidMount(): This method is called after the component has been mounted to the DOM, and is used to perform any side effects, such as fetching data or setting up event listeners.

## 2. Updating Phase: This phase occurs when the component's props or state change, and it needs to be re-rendered. The following methods are called in order:
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state): This method is called again to update state based on changes in props.

shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState): This method is called to determine whether the component should re-render or not, based on changes in props or state. If it returns false, the component does not re-render.

render(): This method is called again to generate the updated HTML markup for the component.

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState): This method is called after render(), but before the component is updated in the DOM, and is used to capture information from the DOM, such as scroll position.

componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot): This method is called after the component has been updated in the DOM, and is used to perform any side effects, such as updating the DOM or fetching data.


## 3. Unmounting Phase: This phase occurs when the component is removed from the DOM. The following method is called:
componentWillUnmount(): This method is called before the component is removed from the DOM, and is used to perform any cleanup, such as removing event listeners or timers.
In summary, the component lifecycle in React consists of the Mounting Phase, Updating Phase, and Unmounting Phase, each with its own set of methods that are called in a specific order. Understanding these phases and methods can help you to better manage the state and behavior of your components.


# Q.7 how can you solve problem because of prop drilling

Prop drilling can occur when you need to pass down props from a parent component to a deeply nested child component through several intermediate components that don't need those props. This can lead to code that is hard to read and maintain, and can also reduce the performance of your app.

Here are some ways to solve the problem of prop drilling:

1.Use React Context: Context is a feature in React that allows you to pass data down the component tree without the need for prop drilling. You can create a context in a parent component, and then access that context in any child component that needs the data.

2. Use a state management library: State management libraries like Redux or MobX can help you manage global state across your entire app, eliminating the need for prop drilling.

3.Create a higher-order component (HOC): You can create a HOC that wraps a component and passes down the necessary props to that component. This can make it easier to manage the props, and can also make the code more reusable.

4.Use the React hook useReducer: You can use the useReducer hook to manage state in a parent component, and then pass the state and the dispatch function down to child components using context. This can help to reduce the amount of prop drilling needed.

Overall, the key to solving the problem of prop drilling is to find a way to manage state in a way that reduces the need to pass props down through multiple layers of components. By using context, state management libraries, HOCs, or the useReducer hook, you can simplify your code and improve the performance of your app.
